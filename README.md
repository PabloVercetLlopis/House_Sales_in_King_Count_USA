# Housing Price Analysis in Seattle

This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the creation of predictive models to estimate housing prices in Seattle using a real estate dataset. The analysis is conducted using Python tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.

## Project description

In this project, a dataset containing information about various properties in Seattle is analyzed, with variables such as the number of rooms, bathrooms, square footage, and additional features like whether the property has a waterfront view. The objective is to explore how different housing characteristics affect their price and to build a model to predict the price based on these features.

## Project structure

The project includes the following steps:

1. **Library Import**: Importing essential libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn.
2. **Data Loading**: The dataset is loaded from a remote CSV file.
3. **Data Exploration**: Descriptive analysis of the columns and review of null values.
4. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, removing unnecessary columns, and correcting data types.
5. **Exploratory Analysis**: Visual analysis of variable distributions and their relationship with housing prices.
6. **Modeling**: Applying a linear regression model to predict housing prices.
7. **Evaluation**: Model evaluation and result visualization.

## Technologies Used

**Python**: Primary programming language.
**Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
**Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
**Seaborn**: Statistical graphics.
**Scikit-learn**: Machine learning modeling.
